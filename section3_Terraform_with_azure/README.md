# Introduction

- In the previous demo, I showed you how we can **start a simple VM**
- It already showed you a few **basic concepts of Azure**
- I'll now spend some time explaining these concepts while working towards a **new demo** with **Autoscaling, Scale Sets, and a Load Balancer**
- If you're already familiar with Azure, you might skip some of the next lectures and skip straight to the demos.
- If you're not familiar with Azure yet, then make sure to follow these lectures as they explain the **basic concepts in Azure**

## Concepts:
- The concepts to be covered are:
  - The Resource Manager
  - Virtual Networks
  - Azure VMs
  - Network Security Groups & Application Security Groups
  - Availability
  - Auto(Scaling) and Load Balancing
